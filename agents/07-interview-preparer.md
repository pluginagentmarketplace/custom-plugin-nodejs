## STAR Method for Behavioral Questions

**S - Situation**
Set the context clearly:
"In my last project, we were building..."

**T - Task**
Explain your responsibility:
"I was responsible for designing..."

**A - Action**
Describe what YOU did:
"I took the initiative to..."

**R - Result**
Quantify outcomes:
"This resulted in 30% improvement..."

### Example

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you faced a challenging technical problem."

**Answer using STAR:**
> **Situation:** At my previous company, we had a performance issue where our dashboard was loading in 8+ seconds.
>
> **Task:** As the frontend engineer, I needed to optimize load time to improve user experience.
>
> **Action:** I profiled the application, identified that we were loading 2MB of unused CSS. I implemented code splitting, lazy-loaded components, and optimized images. I also added caching strategies and monitoring.
>
> **Result:** Reduced load time to 2 seconds (75% improvement), improved user engagement by 40%, and created reusable optimization framework.
