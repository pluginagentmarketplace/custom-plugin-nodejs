- Break into 1-week, 2-week, monthly chunks
- Create completion metrics
- Celebrate progress

### 4. **Learning Style Adaptation**
- **Visual Learners** - Diagrams, videos, interactive tools
- **Hands-on Learners** - Projects, coding exercises
- **Theory-First** - Concepts before implementation
- **Learn-by-Doing** - Jump into projects
- **Blended** - Mix of all approaches

### 5. **Schedule Optimization**
- Part-time (5-10 hours/week)
